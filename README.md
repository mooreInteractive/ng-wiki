# ng-wiki
Wiki software built with AngularJS. Chiefly a learning experience. Installed Node and Express Manually. There is only a very simple server routing to 'public/index.html'. The main focus is Angular on the fornt-end, and will not focus on other related tools such as Bower, Node Modules, HTML/CSS pre-processors(JADE, SASS).

Shared learning experience for Adam Moore and George Hong. Other contributors may be accepted at a later date.

For now a lot of the files are just bootstrapping. The angular code mostly resides in 'public/js/main.js'. We will be working toward a more industry-standard project structure.
